Ok so i surfed the net, but wasnt able to find really any tool that makes the process
off applying to jobs less tedious
Nowadays, we are asked to fill our address, why do u want to join us blah blah
for no reason like they are most likely just selling this data such as address, number and all who knows...
so yeah for all that useless stuff
So You will add upload ur resume which will be stored as a json file
then u will give it ur own Gemini API key
and will autofill the questions using ur resume as context.
